Zen default sidebar and top bar taking too much space so i make it thinner
to learn how to apply the costom css use the zen docs [here](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing)

make sure you are in Multiple Toolbar mode or Collapsed Toolbar Mode (Currently not working well with single toolbar mode)
