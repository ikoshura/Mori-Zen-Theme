# Mori-Zen-Theme

The default Zen sidebar and top bar take up too much space, so I created a thinner, more compact design.

To learn how to apply custom CSS, refer to the [Zen documentation](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing)

**Important:** Make sure you are in **Multiple Toolbar** mode or **Collapsed Toolbar** mode. 
 > This theme currently doesn't work well with Single Toolbar mode, for Single Toolbar mode you can use [Finito](https://github.com/ikoshura/Mori-Zen-Theme/releases/tag/v.0.9).

This theme is built on top of [Arc_Zen_Theme](https://github.com/neurokitti/Arc_Zen_Theme/tree/main) and [ZenMods](https://github.com/KiKaraage/ZenMods/tree/main/%5BSetup%5D%20Arc%20Mode%20on%20Zen)

Special thanks to [neurokitti](https://github.com/neurokitti) and [KiKaraage](https://github.com/KiKaraage)

> **Note:** For using this theme you need to set Zen URL Bar begaviour to `Always Floating`
